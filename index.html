                    Dear Mom,  
                    From the very first moment I opened my eyes, you were there – my protector, my guide, my greatest source of love.  
                    Your unwavering kindness, patience, and endless sacrifices have shaped the person I am today.  
                    Through every challenge, your love has been my anchor, and in every triumph, your smile has been my greatest reward.  
                    I am beyond grateful for your warmth, wisdom, and the countless ways you make the world a better place.  
                    Today, I celebrate you – not just for being an incredible mother, but for being the heart of our family.  
                    I love you endlessly. 💖
